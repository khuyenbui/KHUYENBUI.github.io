       <p> Hi, I'm Khuyen. Hailing from Vietnam, I am current a student from Tufts University, majoring in Computer Science. <br />
       I care a lot about connection and learning, in both the daily life sense and the computer science sense.
       For me, thinking is fun, and so is doing, feeling, learning, writing, meditating, training, talking, listening, programming, producing crap (literally and metaphorically), working with people, being with people, loving people etcâ€¦ Basically, living is fun. It is also very hard, so I have to practice everyday. I especially like writing. I journal everyday, and sometimes I publish on my blog

        about life and what I observe. If you resonate, feel free to connect with me via email <a href="mailto:EMAIL">g.khuyen@gmail.com</a>
